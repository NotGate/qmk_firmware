## Rhythmic
The left and right hands are mirrored versions of each other, meaning you can always alternate your hands.  
Typing at high speeds just involves alternating your hands faster and faster.  
This starts to resemble playing a rhythm game like Taiko (omitting the hand-sync): https://youtu.be/m2KY8Agytvg?t=40  
Many top Taiko players can alternate their hands like this from 15-25 times per second.  
Typing 120 WPM is roughly 10 CPS.  

## Uniform
This keyboard is not meant to be fast at English.  
It's meant to be **equally** as fast at typing **anything**.  
Every input is a basic chord and you're always alternating your hands, so typing basic English:  
`the dog jumped over the log`  
*feels* the same as typing:  
`!@#$%^&*()_{}:}$*#&@:}*_*,.`  

## Generic
Every character is a simple chord.  
I purposely put minimal effort into the layout of these chords to reinforce the fact all characters are created equally.  
However, the alphabet chords have been loosely arranged by popularity so that one finger does not end up putting in more work than another.  

## Layout
Let's talk about the actual layout now:

The layout is centered around your 3 main fingers: index, middle, and ring. With these 3 fingers you can type the entire alphabet with just 2 rows.  
The following list attempts to illustrate this visually: `v=bottom row, ^=top row, -=nothing`.  
```
a --vv- -vv--
b -vvv- -vvv-
c -^-v- -v-^-
d -v-^- -^-v-
e -v-v- -v-v-
f -^^v- -v^^-
g -vv^- -^vv-
h -v^-- --^v-
i -^-^- -^-^-
j --^-- --^--
k --v-- --v--
l --^v- -v^--
m -v^v- -v^v-
n --^^- -^^--
o -^^-- --^^-
p -v^^- -^^v-
q -^--- ---^-
r --v^- -^v--
s -^v-- --v^-
t -vv-- --vv-
u -^v^- -^v^-
v -v___ ___v-
w -^^^- -^^^-
x ---v- -v---
y -^vv- -vv^-
z ---^- -^---
```

Neat. The other `97-26` ASCII characters are handled with modifiers for the pinkie or thumb.  
Capitals are simply achieved by pressing down both the upper thumb and pinkie buttons:  
```
A: ^-vv^ ^vv-^
```

TODO: Reference the code if you want to know the rest of the `97-52` characters.
